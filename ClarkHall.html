Clark Hall

I didn’t expect my first Move-In Day to be as hectic as it was. If anything, it seemed like a modern take on D-Day. Every time I tried to head back towards our car to grab something, someone was barreling up the stairs. 

I had gotten to campus at around nine in the morning, which really sucked, because I hadn’t had a great night of sleep. I felt as though someone was pulling my cheeks towards the ground, but I figured that if I unpacked soon enough, I could crash for a few minutes before my roommate showed up. So, I persevered. 

There weren’t many things to unpack. A few cardboard boxes full of clothes, sheets, a microwave, and various packages of soap and other things of that nature. Once they were put away, the room almost felt homey. My mother was convinced otherwise. 

“But why doesn’t this building have air conditioning? It almost seems like they're trying torture you. You know, I could talk to someone for you.” She was looking for things to criticize about the room. It was too small, stuffy, and if I sniffed carefully, it would smell like old hard boiled eggs. 

“I’m fine, Mom.” That was a phrase I utilized a lot that day. I couldn’t help that she was trying to make up for lost time, like she was trying to treat me like a child for as long as she could before I was out of her grasp. I put my hand on her shoulder sympathetically. She sighed. 

My roommate came in a few minutes later. I had sent James a few emails a few weeks back, and he had seemed pretty cool. He was from Palo Alto, and was going to be playing baseball for the school. When I first met him, I had no idea that he was going to be as tall as he was. He was a good four inches taller than me, and had cropped, curly hair. Needless to say, he looked like a jock. 

“Hi… I’m… uh… Peter.” I introduced myself, extending my hand. I kept forgetting that I thought I was more social than I was. He didn’t care. 

“Hey, Pete!” He took my hand and pulled me into a hug. It was a surefire way to stun me. “This’ll be great.” He didn’t really ask about me, but I knew that his intentions were good. I thought that he and I would get along well enough. 

The afternoon dragged on. James and I got our student ID cards and met a few more students on the way. My mother wanted to start heading back home in the early evening, as it was about a thirteen hour drive back to Colorado Springs. She gave me a hug. 

“Call me if you need anything. I’m being completely serious, sweetheart. Even if it’s just to talk to your old mother, call me,” she said, half crying. She told me that she loved me, and then got back into her car and started her drive. I was now on my own. Well, almost. I at least had James.
