<p><b>Tree - 1st Year</b><p>

<p>The tree offered a healthy dose of shade. I was sitting outside of my dorm, enjoying the sunny Saturday afternoon. The leaves were crisping on the trees before delicately falling to the ground. I tried to focus on my reading assignment, but I couldn't concentrate on the E. E. Cummings poem I was staring at.<p>

<p> God, I couldn't wait for fall break.<p>

<p>There were still two more weeks of class, but I was fried.<p>

<p> I shut my eyes, enjoying the sound of the trees rustling.<p>

<p>I could feel myself drifing off.<p>

<p>Nodding off.<p>

<p>"Peter, wake up." My shoulder was nudged. I brushed it off. "Peter, for the love of God, wake up." I opened my eyes. Robin was crouching in front of me. I didn't know if I was awake or not.<p>
  
 <p>"Come on, I have to talk to you." She poked me hard enough in the shoulder that by reflex, I brought my hand to my chest.<p>
<p>"What the hell's up with your hands? You have talons or something?"<p>
<p>"Just tell me this straight. Like a hundred percent straight. Don't sugar coat anything." She was avoiding the topic. It was bizarre to see her dodging this, especially because she was the girl who told me how she had once pulled out her own ingrown toenail. I couldn't imagine anything could be more difficult to share, or even hear.<p>
<p>"You realize that I'm not going to be able to tell you anything if you don't prompt me." She sat down next to me and crossed her arms, unamused by my lack of sensitivity to her cause.<p>
<p>"Fine. Do you like me? Like I know that you tolerate me, but do you like me in a way that you're not expressing to me?" I bit my lip trying to hold in my laughter. <i>That</i> was her question? I thought that I was being completely obvious when I was hitting on her. I took a few seconds to regain my cool composure and make it seem like I wasn't laughing at her. Truth be told, I probably looked like I really had to use the bathroom.<p>
<p>"Well, yeah." <i>Nice going, Pete</i>. She looked extremely content with herself, but unsure of my answer.<p>
 <p>"So what now?" She asked me. I scoffed at her.<p>
 <p>"I don't know. You were the one who approached me in the first place. What were your motives here?"<p>
  <p>"Maybe I didn't want to assume you were into me before telling you that I am.<p>
<p>Neither of us really had anything else to say.<p>
<p>She rested her head on my chest and took my hand.<p>
<p>Her hands were soft. They could have even been smaller than the rain.<p>
