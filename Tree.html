<p><b>Tree - 1st Year</b><p>

<p>The tree offered a healthy dose of shade. I was sitting outside of my dorm, enjoying the sunny Saturday afternoon. The leaves were crisping on the trees before delicately falling to the ground. I tried to focus on the calculus homework in front of me, but I just deal with integrals at the moment. I had spent a long time doing homework, and I felt like a break.<p>

<p> God, I couldn't wait for fall break.<p>

<p>There were still two more weeks of class, but I was fried.<p>

<p> I shut my eyes, enjoying the sound of the trees rustling.<p>

<p>I could feel myself drifing off.<p>

<p>Nodding off.<p>

<p>"Peter, wake up." My shoulder was nudged. I brushed it off. "Peter, for the love of God, wake up." I opened my eyes. Robin was standing in front of me,
