<p><b>Third Floor of Burling Library - 3rd Year</b><p>
<p>I appreciated how quiet the library could be on a Saturday afternoon. The third floor was completely desolate, which made it a perfect location to work on high stress assignments.<p>

<p>I was working on a research proposal, which seemed more intense than any old assignment.<p>
