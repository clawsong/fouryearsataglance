<p><b>Third Floor of Burling Library - 3rd Year</b><p>
<p>I appreciated how quiet the library could be on a Saturday afternoon. The third floor was completely desolate, which made it a perfect location to work on high stress assignments.<p>

<p>I was working on a research proposal, which seemed more intense than any old assignment.<p>
<p>I was trying to figure out different ways of chemically purifying water to see which was the most ethical and cost effective, as well as determining the practicality of each method. I was hoping to do this research with my advisor, which was fitting, given the fact that he recently spent a lot of time trying to restore the chemical balance in the pool.<p>
<p>I finished my research proposal, carefully scanning the page for any misspellings or passive voice. I saved the document for further revision, and emailed my advisor to see if I could meet with him.<p> 
<p>I closed my computer and went downstairs. James was working at the circulation desk. I gave him a quick nod before leaving the library.<p>
<p>I was hungry, but I felt too busy to be hungry. I ignored my feelings and went to the dining hall to engorge myself with sausage pizza. I promised myself that I'd run six miles the next day to make up for me eating such greasy, delicious food.<p>
