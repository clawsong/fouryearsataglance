<p><b>Younker Hall - 2nd Year</b><p>

<p>I was emailing my current advisor about declaring my major. After much consideration and a plethora of sleepless nights, I decided that I would be a chemistry major. Neglecting to think about previous accidents in lab, I thought that I would have plenty of interesting opportunities after leaving Grinnell. I had no idea what these opportunities were, but I knew that I'd encounter them eventually.<p>

<p>I finished my email and reread it a couple of times to see if I could make it sound a little less desperate. I checked it two more additional times before realizing that I forgot a subject line. It took me another six and a quarter minutes to think of an appropriate subject line.<p> 
<p><i>Declaration of Major</i><p>
<p>That seemed like it'd be sufficient.<p>
<p>I sent the email and flopped down on to my bed. After that much emotional and mental turmoil, I justified a nap.<p>
