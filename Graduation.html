<p><b>Graduation - 4th Year</b><p>
<p>This was the day that we had been anticipating for four years.<p>
<p>We were sitting alphabetically in our matching robes and tassels, waiting for our names to be called. Even though we were in such a familiar place, the whole experience was foreign. I remembered meeting these people four years ago. Somewhere in the midst of these four years, we had grown up.<p>
<p>Graduation didn't pan out as I had expected. I thought that it would last for hours, and that speakers would be telling us about how we need to "spread our wings and fly," but that was such an unrealistic idea. It happened so quickly that I thought that I missed it. My name was called, I grabbed a diploma, and then I was done.<p>
<p>Four years over.<p>
<p>It was like a bandage being ripped off. I walked across the cement stage, smiling. I had no idea what to expect in the coming years. I had gotten into a cycle of continuity and security, and now it felt like I was walking into a dragon's cave with only a stick to defend myself with.<p>
<p>I looked towards the spectators, only to see my mother smiling and crying. She always got emotional seeing me succeed. Usually, I would tell her that she was overreacting, but this time, I figured that I wouldn't make a big deal out of her crying.<p>
<p>I watched my friends graudate, just as I had watched them. I could almost see that they felt the same kind of "what next?" attitude. Even Robin, the girl who I thought had everything wrapped around her finger, seemed to be experiencing a little bit of trepidation.<p>
<p>I almost felt comfort knowing that we were all fighting for ourselves now.<p>
