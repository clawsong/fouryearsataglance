<p><b>Interstate 80 - Epilogue</b><p>

<p>Just like that, it was all over.<p>

<p>We were leaving Grinnell, all of my stuff, along with me and my mom were crammed into my car. I was gripping the wheel too tightly. My knuckles were white.<p>
<p>I couldn’t help but feel like I was leaving a part of myself in Grinnell. I couldn’t believe that I probably never would get hummus at McNally’s or stumble drunkenly to McDonalds at two in the morning to get a burger without mayonnaise and fries. 
I was quiet, but my mother filled the empty air.<p> 
<p>“Are you okay, Sweetie?" My mother asked me, putting her hand on my arm. "You're awfully tense."<p>
<p>"I don't know. It just seems like yesterday I moved here, and you were crying. Now it's four years later, I'm moving away, and you're still crying. It just seems like time hasn't passed."<p>
<p>"You've worked harder than I've ever seen anyone, and it shows. Your time was exchanged for work."<p> Her answer didn't really seem sufficent to me, but I wasn't going to disagree with her.<p>
<p>Time as a whole seemed to be non-linear, as there were moments only having passed weeks ago, that seemed like lightyears away, but moments years ago that seemed like yesterday.<p>
<p>I thought about this for the majority of the drive home, thinking in pieces back to my four years. As I drove further away, my experience seemed like memories stored in an album, slowly reducing themselves from moments in my life to mere glances.<p>

<p>I looked forward and kept driving.<p>
