<p><b>East Parking Lot - 2nd Year </b><p>

<p> Neither Robin and I spoke a word, and the tension between us acted as a sufficient barrier.<p> 
<p>She had asked me to meet her by her car in order to speak in total privacy. She wanted to be in a place where she could be sure that no one would interrupt.<p> 
<p>She was sitting in her car when I got there, and when I sat down, she looked at me for a moment before looking at her hands.<p>

<p>Silence ensued.<p>
<p>"Rob?" I asked tentitively, reaching for her arm. "Is everything okay?" I felt like I was walking on eggshells.<p>
<p>"Of course their fine, great actually, but I just want you to know that I'm going to London next fall. I found out that I got into Grinnell's program this morning."<p>

<p>"Why didn't you call me earlier? That's great news!" I leaned over and awkwardly hugged her.<p> 
<p>"But that means that I'll be gone for a whole semester. I won't see you until January," she said. "It'll be weird without you around." She put her hand on my shoulder.<p>
<p>"I'll still be around on campus. I'm not going anywhere," I tried reassuring. She still had an awkward look on her face. <p>
<p>"You're right. You're not going anywhere. I think that me going abroad is a sign that we should break up." That was the kicker. This made more sense. "I just think that you and I need an opportunity to learn more about each other by ourselves. I want to be able to grow as individuals, and not as a couple."<p>

<p>"Oh."<p>
<p>"Can we still be friends?"<p>
<p><i>Can we still be friends? Is she crazy?</i> I thought. <i>No one actuallly wants to be friends with their ex-boyfriend after they break up. It's hopeful thinking that we'll even talk to each other after I get out of this car.<i><p>
<p>"Yeah, that'd be nice."<p>
