<p><b>Stop Sign - 3rd Year</b><p>

<p>As I was walking back to Lazier from Burling, I noticed that someone had spray-painted a few words on the stop sign by the tracks making it read, "Don't stop me now" in a loopy font.<p>

<p>I don't know who painted those words, or why, but I related to the inspirational optimisim promoted by the sign. It only took me two and half years.<p>
