<p><b>Marketplace Dining Hall - 1st Year</b><p>

<p>I was in an in-depth discussion with Jackson and a few other people about <i>Star Wars</i>. I was there for kicks, but I didn't dare mention that I hadn't seen the series. I had just made friends, and I wasn't prepared to lose them over an argument about a prolonged intergalactic space fight.<p>
<p>I nodded along, finally succumbing to the watery pasta.<p>
<p>Throughout this entire conversation, I wondered what controversy would arise of me saying that I was a huge Tolkien fan.<p>
