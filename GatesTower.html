<p><b>Gates Tower - 2nd Year </b><p>

<p>"How'd you do on the chemistry midterm?" Jackson and I were in his room, playing Mariokart. His question came out of nowhere.<p>
<p>I didn't really want to share the fact that organic chemistry was besting me. I got a seventy-two percent, which wasn't failing, but the score was really disappointing. I was just glad that the school didn't send report cards home, because if my mother knew how I did on this test, I'd be lectured.<p>

<p>"I did okay," I said, trying to return my focus to the game. I was trying to get my character ahead of Princess Peach, but she was too far ahead.<p>

<p>"I got a fifty-seven, but apparently that was around the class average. I'm probably going to go to office hours and see if I can argue a few points back."<p>

<p>I nodded and hoped that Jackson didn't see the tiny smirk that I had on my face as I casually knocked his player off of the course.<p>
