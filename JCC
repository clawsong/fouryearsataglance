John Chrystal Center

I was extremely nervous to be in such an unsettlingly bright building. At other schools that I had visited had grandiose admissions buildings with stained glass and dark woodwork framing the inside almost like a ribcage. But no. 

I sat uncomfortably next to my mother, who was peering over her glasses at her phone. A thick packet sat in my lap. I was slightly excited about the free pen, but I didn’t feel compelled to look through the other information. I didn’t need to see another financial aid statement saying that I was going to be indebted for the rest of my life if I choose to attend. 

I slid down in my chair, but was disgusted to find that my back was sticking to the fabric. Even though the John Chyrstal Center was air conditioned, the July sun persevered. I tried to think about what the weather was like in Grinnell when the heat didn’t make me feel like I had to pass out. It might be nice, I thought. I had to remind myself that weather wasn't the only deciding factor. There were plenty of things I had to keenly observe in order to make a decision of whether or not I was coming here. 

“Peter Milller?” A girl with a clipboard asked, even though she didn’t have to ask. We were the only people waiting for a tour. 

“That would be us.” My mother stood up excitedly, slinging her pocketbook over her shoulders. The girl smiled, all too familiar with over-excited parents. I stood up and half-smiled to show to her that I was actually remotely interested in what she was going to say. She introduced herself as Michaela, and told us that she was a political science major from North Dakota. I wasn’t too concerned with smalltalk, as my mother filled the empty air, asking about anything really. Are students able to get flu shots? Do you think that students have a hard time navigating Grinnell? Is the water pressure decent?

I don’t know why she kept asking these questions. They seemed completely irrelevant to me. I couldn’t care less if the showers sprayed water super well, so long that I got a decent education. 

Michaela walked us around the campus, stopping every so often to give a brief description of each building and what happens in it. We stopped in front of a behemoth of a building. From where we were standing, I couldn’t see the end. All I could really tell was that my mother’s question about navigating the school might just be relevant with this building. 

“This is Noyce,” Michaela said. “This is where all of the science and math classes happen. This building seems super intense, but it’s really not that bad once you walk through it a couple times.” 

As we walked inside of the building, I thanked god that air-conditioning existed. From where we were standing, there were three directions to walk in. I felt like exploring the building, but Michaela, probably wanting to get over with this tour, led us straight towards the exit of the building. 

For the rest of the tour, I zoned out, nodding whenever Michaela mentioned some interesting tid bit about a building. So much for "keen observation." I was too busy focusing on how comfortable Grinnell looked. Compared to the other schools I had seen, the students didn't look as weighted as the others. People seemed as if they were comfortable in their own skin, which I appreciate.

I had made up my mind.
