<p><b>Math Commons - 4th Year</b><p>
<p>I was lying face down in the bean bag chair. I was having a nihilistic meltdown. I had everything after graduation planned. I was going to begin doing doctoral research at Duke this fall, but until then, my life seemed to be in a stagnant place. I had finished conducting research, and by this point, I was mostly coasting until graduation.<p>

<p>I may have been slightly overly dramatic, but I really had nothing else to think about except for the meaningless of everything I was doing on a grand scale.<p>
<p>I sat up, thinking back to the first year of school, and the constant meltdown I was having. I almost regretted the fact that I tried so hard to get myself to a place of stability that I completely breezed by the parts of school that were always advertized to me in the brochures: concerts, study breaks, and plenty of clubs. Thinking about this gave me a headache.<p>
<p>I decided that instead of being left to my own devices, I should probably just read a book or something.<p>
