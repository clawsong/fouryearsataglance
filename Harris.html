<p><b>Harris Center - 2nd Year </b><p>

<p>The small gym-like concert hall was packed with people pressed together dancing in a suffocatingly compressed fashion. It also seemed that everyone was at least moderately intoxicated, given that the most common dance move was similar to the way in which tube men outside of car dealerships flail spastically.<p>

 <p>I was here out of support; Jackson was playing the trombone in a cover disco band, and I wanted to offer support to him. I just wasn't expecting the environment to give me painful memories to the first time I went to Gardner. I shuddered at the thought of it.<p>

  <p>I didn't come with anyone, and I was hoping that Robin would show up, but she hadn't been answering the texts that I had sent her earlier. Given how hard she tackled schoolwork, I wouldn't have been surprised if she was already asleep. I checked the time again before pocketing my phone.<p>
 
<p>After what seemed like an eternity of standing to the side of the room, drinking a soda, the conglomerate hoard of musicians gathered on stage. Jackson was standing near back, his trombone resting on his shoulder. He looked happy, maybe even a little buzzed.<p> 
  
<p>The band started their set with a few songs by Earth, Wind and Fire, which was tolerable, but upsetting because the lead singer's voice was amplified louder than the instrumentalists.<p>
<p>I guess finally a tech assistant came to their senses and reduced the volume slightly and slowly brought up the instuments. The audience seemed to appreciate the change, as there was a small uproar in cheering.<p> 
<p>Jackson seemed to feed off the energy, as he really let himself melt into the music. Even though I was alone, and probably looked strange, I started to dance.<p>
