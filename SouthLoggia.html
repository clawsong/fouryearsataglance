<p><b>South Loggia - 2nd Year</b><p>

<p>I dropped a cinnamon sugar croissant on the dirty loggia floor.<p>

<p>Because I was up until four in the morning doing work, I was sleep deprived enough to consider eating it. It was supposed to be my reward for getting a lot done. I didn't want a slight health inconvenience to ruin that.<p>

<p>Second year was proving to be a lot harder than the previous. I was slouching so much that I felt like I was slowly being dragged to hell.<p>
