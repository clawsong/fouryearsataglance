<p><b>Mears Cottage - 1st Year</b><p>

<p>Finally classes started. It seemed as if New Student Orientation dragged on forever, so it was a relief to delve into academics. Aside from my required tutorial class, I had originally planned to take only math and science courses, but for some ungodly reason I was placed into a literary analysis course. I wasn't upset about reading, but I didn't want to examine text in a dissective manner. It seemed, to me, overly pedantic and unnecessary.<p>

<p>The first day of classes was extremely hot. By the afternoon when I had Literary Analysis, I felt like I was melting into my shoes. I was lucky that Mears was slightly insulated from the heat. For some reason, I felt like I was invading the premises when I first entered the building because it just seemed like someone's house. After making my way to the second floor and to the classroom, I was greeted with the blank stares of unaquaited faces. I pressed my lips into a weird lopsided smile and sat down, really not ready to interact with anyone new.<p>

<p>The professor must have realized that we were completely uncomfortable with the situation at hand, and decided that we should learn each other's names and get to know each other a little bit better. We started the intolerable circle of ice-breakers. I was indifferent until the fifth or sixth student.<p>

<p>"Hi.. uh... I'm Robin Maler. I'm a first year from Western Pennyslavania." Needless to say, I was very interested that she was from Western Pennyslavania. I got to get a closer look at her, that I didn't get when I first met her. She had really short red hair and a constellation of freckles on her face to match. She had an almost intense look to her face, like she was very closely interpreting and analyzing what everyone had to say about themselves. I could see why she'd want to join this class.<p>

<p>The professor began to start talking about <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and gave the first reading assignment before class was dismissed. I caught up to Robin in order to formally introduce myself, and maybe try to give her an accurate second first impression.<p>

<p>"Hi, I don't think I actually got to formally introduce myself," I really had no idea what else to say, because the way she looked at me was stunning.<p>

<p>"Peter Miller from Colorado Springs. Yup," She said. <p>

<p>"But that's such a shallow introduction. I mean, I am also a very sloppy drunk, and enjoy pretty paintings of birds."<p> That elicited a chuckle. "Did you happen to finish the painting? I think I interrupted your creative process."<p>

<p>"I can show you, if you like."<p>
