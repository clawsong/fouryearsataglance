<p><b>Observatory - 4th Year</b><b>

<p>I was always impressed and terrified by how small we really were in the grand scheme of things. I think the operator of the telescope was aware that there were conflicting thoughts going on in my head. He and I made eye contact for a few moments while a few other people were looking through the scope. The moment that we shared seemed special. I truly believe at this moment, this stranger completely understood the turmoil inside of my head.<p>

<p>It was a beautiful reminder that humans, by nature, aren't completely terrible.<p>
