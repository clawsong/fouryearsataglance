<p><b>Sebring Lewis Hall - 1st Year </b><p>
  
<p>I had no idea what I was doing with my life.<p>
<p>I was sitting in the middle of an audience, watching Robin sing a beatiful, melancholy piece for her semester voice recital. I peered into the program again. <i>The Black Swan<i> seemed to be such an uncharacteristic song for her. The piece focused on a woman gradually going crazy, but that was the complete opposite of Robin. She was in such a stable place at Grinnell. She had already made lasting impressions in both the English and music departments.<p>

<p>I still had no idea what I was doing. It was almost a feeling of a lack of control; however, it wasn't anything like the nihilistic tantrums I would throw myself into when I would question what happened after death. This was more like a weight digging into my shoulders.<p>

<p>I thought that I would major in chemistry. It was something that I was actually pretty good at, but there were so many things that I didn't know about it.<p> 

	<p><i>Well at least I have that taken care of,</i> I thought to myself. I still had three and a half years to get my act together.<p>

<p>I began to compare this experience to climbing Mt. Everest. It was a shame that I had zero equipment to reach the peak.<p>

<p>Or at least that was what I thought at the time.<p>
