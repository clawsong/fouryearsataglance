<p>Gardner Lounge<p>

<p>I felt as though my face was a cinnamon drop. I was bright red and felt extremely horrendously warm. I was in the midst of my first serious interaction with hard liquor, and I could tell the next morning I would shiver at the thought of anything fermented. But for the moment, I felt great, like I should be dancing. Why wasn’t I dancing? I tried to dance, but my joints were lubricated with alcohol. I found that the only thing I could really pull off was something that looked like a sea-sick version of the Carlton.<p> 

<p>It was weird that there was literally a concert hall in the basement of the dorm, but I think I was the only person who even considered batting an eye.<p>

<p>I was originally planning on staying in my room tonight, but James invited me to go to a concert with him and his baseball friends, but he was extremely persistent. We went as a pack to a different dorm in South Campus. Cleveland maybe? I didn’t really care, because I was moderately belligerent in going anywhere. That was until I was handed something to drink.<p>

<p>I started cracking smiles and jokes. One guy, Parker, thought that I was absolutely hilarious. He kept patting me on the back and chortling whenever I said anything with any ounce of comedic intent.<p> 

<p>The concert was in full swing by the time we had gotten to Gardner. People were packed together, dancing to the erratic music that was being performed. I didn’t recognize any of the songs, but it was something that I could see my alter ego listening to. The entire scene was completely overwhelming, but it seemed ultimately better than sitting alone in my room for the duration of the night.<p> 

<p>Maybe forty minutes into dancing, I felt like my legs were going to give out, and I decided that I would rather sit down by my own will, instead of collapsing on the floor and getting trampled. From what I could see, there was an open door about fifteen feet away from me. The real challenge was weaving my way through the stagnant stampede of people in front of me. It took me another ten minutes to squeeze out, but I was successful in my efforts.<p> 

 <p>I found my self walking, (stumbling,) down a hall. The walls were painted vividly. Murals of coffee cups and collages of poetry covered the walls. I had a few questions entering Bob's Underground Cafe. <i>Where could I find water? Can I sit? WHO IS BOB?<i> Although, I was mostly intrigued by a girl standing on the table of a booth, holding a paintbrush. She was painting part of the wall with blue paint. When she ducked to look at her palette, I could see that she was painting a white dove, presumably a dove. Of course, being the drunken idiot that I was, I felt obliged to ask her.<p>

  <p>I intended to ask her what the bird meant on some metaphorical way, or if the image had any significance to her, but what came out was completely the opposite of what I expected.<p>
  <p>"Pretty bird," I said, immediately before hiccuping. What a fantastic first impression.
  <p>"Thank you," she said, almost giggling. She stepped down from her perch. "You seem a little sloshed, but thank you." She seemed completely calm given the fact that I, this random, potentially creepy, drunk guy, had approached her. "Just because you look like you're about to pass out, we should probably get you out of here. Come on." She extended her hand and grabbed mine.<p>
  
  <p>She and I left Bob's. She was very tolerant with me, given that I was probably acting like a belligerant toddler. She gripped my arm, hoisting me up the stairs of Main. After two flights of stairs, I was spinning. <i>I need to throw up. Badly.<i> I tried, with what little ounce of dignity and chivalry I had left, pulling away from her to avoid throwing up to her. I yanked my arm away and barely made it to a trashcan before upchucking.<p> 
   
 <p>"At least it's out of your system, yeah?" She said. She took hold of me again and led me to her room. From the sign on the door, I could tell that her name started with the letter "R." That's all I got before she unlocked the door and led me inside. She took off my vomit-stained shirt and laid me on her bed. She told me that she was going to get me some water. I nodded, falling asleep.<p>
   
<p>The next morning I woke up sufficiently startled, and hungover. I could vaguely remember a girl painting, but I couldn't remember anything after I talked to her about her painting. I rolled over and saw her at her desk.<p>

 <p>"Oh, you're awake." She leaned back in her chair. 
 <p> "What the hell happened?" I sat up.<p>
 <p> "I didn't want you to be on your own. You were completely trashed, and I didn't want you to die of alcohol poisoning. Simple."<p>
 <p>"I appreciate that. Thanks..." I struggled for her name.<p>
 <p>"My name is Robin."<p>
