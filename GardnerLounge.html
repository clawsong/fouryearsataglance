<p>Gardner Lounge<p>

<p>I felt as though my face was a cinnamon drop. I was bright red and felt extremely horrendously warm. I was in the midst of my first serious interaction with hard liquor, and I could tell the next morning I would shiver at the thought of anything fermented. But for the moment, I felt great, like I should be dancing. Why wasn’t I dancing? I tried to dance, but my joints were lubricated with alcohol. I found that the only thing I could really pull off was something that looked like a sea-sick version of the Carlton.<p> 

<p>It was weird that there was literally a concert hall in the basement of the dorm, but I think I was the only person who even considered batting an eye.<p>

<p>I was originally planning on staying in my room tonight, but James invited me to go to a concert with him and his baseball friends, but he was extremely persistent. We went as a pack to a different dorm in South Campus. Cleveland maybe? I didn’t really care, because I was moderately belligerent in going anywhere. That was until I was handed something to drink.<p>

<p>I started cracking smiles and jokes. One guy, Parker, thought that I was absolutely hilarious. He kept patting me on the back and chortling whenever I said anything with any ounce of comedic intent.<p> 

<p>The concert was in full swing by the time we had gotten to Gardner. People were packed together, dancing to the erratic music that was being performed. I didn’t recognize any of the songs, but it was something that I could see my alter ego listening to. The entire scene was completely overwhelming, but it seemed ultimately better than sitting alone in my room for the duration of the night.<p> 

<p>Maybe forty minutes into dancing, I felt like my legs were going to give out, and I decided that I would rather sit down by my own will, instead of collapsing on the floor and getting trampled. From what I could see, there was an open door about fifteen feet away from me. The real challenge was weaving my way through the stagnant stampede of people in front of me. It took me another ten minutes to squeeze out, but I was successful in my efforts.<p> 

 <p>I found my self walking, (stumbling,) down a hall. The walls were painted vividly. Murals of coffee cups and collages of poetry covered the walls. I had a few questions entering Bob's Underground Cafe. <i>Where could I find water? Can I sit? WHO IS BOB?<i><p>
   
 <p>I was mostly just excited that I had left the hive of people in Gardner. I sat down in a booth, thankful that I wasn't putting any more pressure on my legs.
