<p><b>Noyce 2021 - 1st Year</b><p?

<p>I didn't think that I would love introductory chemistry as much as I did. I basically knew how to do everything in the class, but I had made a friend that wasn't a part of the baseball clique my roommate was in. His name was Jackson and he was equally unimpressed by the course material of the class.<p>
  
<p>He and I sat together in the back of the lecture hall every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, doing some course work, but ultimately chatting with each other over email. It was a good system, except for the times I would crack a smile, according to my professor, for no reason.<p>

<p>Jackson did like to hold the fact that I spilled 0.100 molar hydrochloric acid all over the counter during our second lab over my head. It was mostly in jest, but it was actually really annoying to come into class with a bottle of water, only for him to see if the cap was tightly closed. Even though he was an asshole, he was a genuinely good person.<p>

<p>"We still on to play Battlefront tonight?" He asked me.<p>
<p>"Yeah. Smith Lounge?" He nodded. I was thrilled to have plans on the weekend, but I really was not a Star Wars fan. It just didn't appeal to me. To prepare for this night, I had looked up the basics of this game. I was shocked that there wasn't some giant Star Wars plot; in fact, it was basically just a game of Star Wars themed tag.<p>

<p>Jackson fist-bumped me and a few moments later class began. The professor pulled up a Powerpoint slide showing a base being titrated with 0.100 molar hydrochloric acid. I could see from the corner of my eye, that Jackson was smirking at me.<p>
