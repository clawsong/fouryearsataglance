<p><b>Main Hall - 1st Year</b><p>

<p>Robin and I spent a lot of time in Main Hall. This was because it was right next to Mears, and also, Clark often smelled like molding cheese. We spent some time working, mainly reviewing notes from our respective classes, but mostly we just sat around and shot the breeze, talking about whatever we felt was remotely important in our day to day lives.<p>
  
<p>Robin would often talk to me about her older sister Diana, and would criticize her life choices. About how dropping out of college was the worst thing that she have possibly done, and how she should get her life together. I never knew how to respond to her. I mean, how was I supposed to respond to her telling me how stupid her sister is? I couldn't blatantly agree with her without seeming like a jerk.<p>

  <p>Needless to say, we became confidants for each other. I learned about her idosyncrasies when it came to storing her paints in color order by composition, and she learned stupid things from me, like my irrational distrust for squirrels. Our desire to just complete work dwindled, and we often just talked.<p>
    <p>I mostly just completely work in my room.<p>
  <p>I didn't just want
