<p><b>Whale Room - 4th Year</b><p>
<p>I usually came to this room to avoid the lunchtime melee of voracious students. I would review my notes while picking through a spinach salad.<p>
<p>I was reading through my notes for my linear algebra course when the door creaked. I had come to view the Whale Room as my personal enclosure; there were few places on campus where I was able to enjoy isolation, and it seemed rude for someone to enter.<p>
<p>A group of younger students, maybe first or second years, glared at me before sitting down across the room. They didn't seem to care that I was sitting there, but it annoyed me that the majority of the semester had passed without them sitting here, and now, in late April, they had decided it opportune to sit here. I would have gotten angry, but it made as much sense for them to be there as it did for me.<p>
<p>My genius solution was to put on a pair of headphones and listen to ambient rain sounds. It was a decent way to block out noise, without the distraction of voices.<p>
<p>I turned the page and carried on with my reading. Out of the corner of my eye, I could just see the movement of one of the girl's lips.<p>
