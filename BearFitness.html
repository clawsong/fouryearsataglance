<p><b>Bear Fitness Center - 2nd Year</b><p>

<p>I groaned as I lifted the weights above my head. I could feel the blood pounding in my ears, which convinced me that my head was about to pop like a grape. I held the weight until my arms started to twitch, and even though I attempted to gently set down the weight, it slammed down loudly.<p>

<p>Needless to say, I was not athletically inclined in the slightest. The only reason I was here was because exercise was the one thing in my life that I felt like I could control. Additionally, a lot of my clothes were beginning to feel tighter in the waistband.<p>

<p>I considered getting on the treadmill. I ran cross-country in high school for about three weeks, so this didn't seem as far fetched as lifting weights. As soon as I approached a machine, I felt inadequate. There were five or six people sprinting their hearts out, and here I was.<p>

<p><i>It can't be that hard,</i> I thought. I stepped up and looked at the speeds. The person next to me was running at a pace of eight miles an hour. I could do that.<p>

<p>Turns out, I couldn't do that. I lasted maybe three minutes before I felt like the friction between my arms and my torso could start a fire. Against my rib cage, my heart felt like a tympany that was strung too tightly. I resorted to walking.<p>

<p>Later that evening, Robin and I were together in her room. She was leaning against me with her computer on her lap, writing a paper about <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>. I was looking over a problem set for my organic chemistry course. I set my papers down.<p>

<p>"Quick question, Rob," I noted. She lowered the screen of her computer.<p>
<p>"Mmhm?" She said, resting her head on my shoulder.<p>
<p>"Do you think that I've gained weight? Or, more specifically, can you tell if I have?" She was silent for a moment.<p>
<p>"It's not important if you have or haven't. I like you the way that you are." She lightly kissed my neck and returned to her paper.<p>

<p>She didn't answer my question, but I didn't need her response to know that yes, I looked different, and yes, she noticed.<p>

<p>It bothered me more than I found to be pragmatic.<p>
