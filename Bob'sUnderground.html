<p><b>Bob's Underground Cafe - 3rd Year</b><p>

<p>I sighed as I realized just how long my humanities reading was. I was still slightly annoyed that my advisor wanted me to take humanities as a chemistry major. I much preferred reading about chromatographic methods of organic synthesis instead of Achilles' relationship with Patroklos.<p>

<p>I sat in a booth with my copy of the Iliad and a highlighter in my hand. There was a cup of stale coffee sitting in front of me. Even though the drink made me wrinkle my nose, it would help me survive seventy pages of Homeric writing.<p>

<p>I leaned foward and began my reading. Achilles seemed to be a little too angry over Brisies in my personal opinion. I thought that by trying to act remotely interested in what I was reading would make it more tolerable.<p> 
<p>Twenty minutes passed. I set my book down in order to fish for a granola bar buried in my backpack. As I was pulling it out, I noticed that on the wall across the room was the dove that Robin was painting the first night I met her.<p>
<p>The bird itself was half obscured by a smattering of text, but it was still recognizable without a doubt.<p>
<p>Robin was in London now, and I was here staring at an old, half-sober memory of our relationship.<p>

<p>I was never really angry with her after we broke up. In fact, I hoped that she was doing well, but that's all I really hoped for Robin. I didn't think of her in the same way that I did when we were dating. She didn't dictate as much as my life as she thought she did, which is how I was able to move on so quickly.<p>

<p>I took on final look at the bird and then returned to my book, anticipating more dramatic behavior from Achilles.<p>
